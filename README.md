A frontend interface for handling customer appointments that I'm making for my barber.
Needs to be paired with the backend package of the same name that allows for customer management and database operations.

VITE_BACKEND_URL_PROD = "http://ip:port"
VITE_BACKEND_URL_DEV = "http://localhost:port"
VITE_PROD_ENV = "DEV" #or PROD
